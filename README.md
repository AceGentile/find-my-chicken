# find-my-chicken

A React Web Application that tracks user's location using IP address from the source of request.

- Built using [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) Kit
- [Mapbox-gl](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/) to visualize maps.
- [IPApi](https://ipapi.co/) to get Location from IP address.

### Demo

*Note*: For time being, the App only tracks 8.8.8.8

### TODO 
- Switch between dark and light themes in Mapbox reactively.
- Dynamically locate user using IP from `req`
